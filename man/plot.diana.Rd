\title{
Plots of a Divisive Hierarchical Clustering
}
\description{
Creates plots for visualizing a \code{diana} object.
}
\usage{
plot.diana(x, ask=F, \dots)


}
\arguments{
\item{x}{
an object of class \code{"diana"}, created by the function \code{diana}.
}
\item{ask}{
if TRUE, \code{plot.diana} operates in interactive mode.
Graphical parameters (see \code{\link{par}}) may also
be supplied as arguments to this function.


}}
\value{
a NULL value is returned.


}
\section{Side Effects}{
An appropriate plot is produced on the current graphics device. This can
be one or both of the following choices:
Banner
Clustering tree
}
\details{
When \code{ask=T}, rather than producing each plot sequentially,
\code{plot.diana} displays a menu listing all the plots that can be produced.
If the menu is not desired but a pause between plots is still wanted
one must set \code{par(ask=T)} before invoking the plot command.


The banner displays the hierarchy of clusters, and is equivalent to a tree.
See Rousseeuw (1986) or chapter 6 of Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990).
The banner plots the diameter of each cluster being splitted.
The observations are listed in the order found by the \code{diana} algorithm, and 
the numbers in the \code{height} vector are represented as bars between the 
observations.


The leaves of the clustering tree are the original observations.
A branch splits up at the diameter of the cluster being splitted.
}
\section{NOTE}{
In the banner plot,
observation labels are only printed when the number of observations is 
limited to less than 35, for readability.
Moreover, observation labels are truncated to at most 5 characters.
