\title{Divisive Analysis (DIANA) Object}
\description{
  The objects of class \code{"diana"}
  represent a divisive hierarchical clustering of a dataset.
}
\section{GENERATION}{
  This class of objects is returned from \code{\link{diana}}.
}
\section{METHODS}{
  The \code{"diana"} class has methods for the following generic functions:
  \code{print}, \code{summary}, \code{plot}.
}
\section{INHERITANCE}{
  The class \code{"diana"} inherits from \code{"twins"}.
  Therefore, the generic function \code{pltree} can be used on a
  \code{diana} object, and an \code{\link{as.hclust}} method is
    available.
}
\value{
  A legitimate \code{diana} object is a list with the following components:
  \item{order}{
    a vector giving a permutation of the original observations to allow for
    plotting, in the sense that the branches of a clustering tree will
    not cross.
  }
  \item{order.lab}{
    a vector similar to \code{order}, but containing observation labels
    instead of observation numbers. This component is only available if
    the original observations were labelled.
  }
  \item{height}{a vector with the diameters of the clusters prior to splitting.
  }
  \item{dc}{
    the divisive coefficient, measuring the clustering structure of the
    dataset.  For each observation i, denote by d(i) the diameter of the
    last cluster to which it belongs (before being split off as a single
    observation), divided by the diameter of the whole dataset.  The
    \code{dc} is the average of all 1 - d(i).  It can also be seen as the
    average width (or the percentage filled) of the banner plot.
    Because \code{dc} grows with the number of observations, this
    measure should not be used to compare datasets of very different
    sizes.
  }
  \item{merge}{
    an (n-1) by 2 matrix, where n is the number of
    observations. Row i of \code{merge} describes the split at step n-i of
    the clustering. If a number j in row r is negative, then the single
    observation |j| is split off at stage n-r. If j is positive, then the
    cluster that will be splitted at stage n-j (described by row j), is
    split off at stage n-r.
  }
  \item{diss}{
    an object of class \code{"dissimilarity"}, representing the total
    dissimilarity matrix of the dataset.
  }
  \item{data}{
a matrix containing the original or standardized measurements, depending
on the \code{stand} option of the function \code{agnes}. If a dissimilarity matrix was
given as input structure, then this component is not available.
  }

## really see example(diana) !   Additionally:
data(votes.repub)
dv0 <- diana(votes.repub, stand = TRUE)
## Cut into 2 groups:
dv2 <- cutree(as.hclust(dv0), k = 2)
table(dv2)
rownames(votes.repub)[dv2 == 1]
