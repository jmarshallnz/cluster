\title{Clustering Large Applications (CLARA) Object}
\description{
  The objects of class \code{"clara"} represent a partitioning of a large
  dataset into clusters and are typically returned from \code{\link{clara}}.
}
\section{Methods, Inheritance}{
  The \code{"clara"} class has methods for the following generic functions:
  \code{print}, \code{summary}.

  The class \code{"clara"} inherits from \code{"partition"}.
  Therefore, the generic functions \code{plot} and \code{clusplot} can
  be used on a \code{clara} object.
}
\value{
  A legitimate \code{clara} object is a list with the following components:

  \item{sample}{
    labels or case numbers of the observations in the best sample, that is,
    the sample used by the \code{clara} algorithm for the final partition.}
  \item{medoids}{
    the medoids or representative objects of the clusters.
    It is a matrix with in each row the coordinates of one medoid.}
  \item{clustering}{
    the clustering vector.  A vector with length equal to the number of 
    observations, giving the number of the cluster to which each
    observation belongs.}
  \item{objective}{
    the objective function for the final clustering of the entire dataset.}
  \item{clusinfo}{
    matrix, each row gives numeric information for one cluster. These
    are the cardinality of the cluster (number of observations), and the
    maximal and average dissimilarity between the observations in the
    cluster and the cluster's medoid. The last column is the maximal
    dissimilarity between the observations in the cluster and the
    cluster's medoid, divided by the minimal dissimilarity between the
    cluster's medoid and the medoid of any other cluster. If this ratio
    is small, the cluster is well-separated from the other clusters.
  }
  \item{silinfo}{
    list with all information necessary to construct a silhouette plot of the
    clustering of the best sample. This list is only available when
    \eqn{1 < k < n}.
    The first component is a matrix, with for each observation i in the best 
    sample, the cluster to which i belongs,
    as well as the neighbor cluster of i (the cluster, not containing
    i, for which the average dissimilarity between its observations and i is
    minimal), and the silhouette width of i.
    The other two components give the average silhouette width per cluster and
    the average silhouette width for the best sample.
    See \code{\link{plot.partition}} for more information.
  }
  \item{diss}{
    an object of class \code{"dissimilarity"}, representing the total
    dissimilarity matrix of the dataset.}
  \item{data}{
    a matrix containing the original or standardized measurements, depending 
    on the \code{stand} option of the function \code{clara}.}
