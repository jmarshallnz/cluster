ORIGINAL README :

  This directory contains code, help and examples for CLUS, an S-PLUS
  package for clustering, as described in ``Clustering in an
  Object-Oriented Environment'' by Anja Struyf, Mia Hubert, and Peter
  J. Rousseeuw (Journal of Statistical Software, volume 1).

For historical reasons,
we keep R/README-Splus which has no relevance to the R package.

TODO {see ./DONE-MM for things done}

 1) Silhouette und Banner Plot :
	Label vertical axis of horizontal barplot using HORIZONTAL text
	{i.e., par(las = 1) or axis(*, las = 1)}

    --> Should become an optional (but probably default)
	feature of barplot()!

 3) daisy() for the case of mixed variables should allow
    a weight vector (of length p = #vars) for up- or downweighing variables.
    daisy() really should accept the other methods mva's dist() does _and_
    it should use dist's C API -- but we have no C API for package code, ARRGH!

 4) Eliminate the many Fortran (g77 -Wall) warnings of the form
    >> mona.f:101: warning: `jma' might be used uninitialized in this function

 6) Mona objects describe a hierarchical clustering; they could also inherit
    from twins, and hence have a pltree() method for plotting the
    hierarchical tree.

------------------

./R/daisy.q  :

  If daisy  objects  inherit from "dist",  we can use  as.matrix() and
  other dist methods which can be *very* useful !

  --> also upgraded ./man/dissimilarity.object.Rd
