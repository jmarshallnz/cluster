ORIGINAL README :

  This directory contains code, help and examples for CLUS, an S-PLUS
  package for clustering, as described in ``Clustering in an
  Object-Oriented Environment'' by Anja Struyf, Mia Hubert, and Peter
  J. Rousseeuw (Journal of Statistical Software, volume 1).

For historical reasons, 
we keep R/README-Splus which has no relevance to the R package.

TODO

 1) Silhouette und Banner Plot : 
	Label vertical axis of horizontal barplot using HORIZONTAL text
	{i.e., par(las = 1) or axis(*, las = 1)}

    --> Should become an optional (but probably default) 
	feature of barplot()!

 2) help files for plot.*() 
	--- new arguments are in *.Rd,
	but not really documented.

 3) daisy() for the case of mixed variables should allow
    a weight vector (of length p = #vars) for up- or downweighing variables.

 4) Eliminate the many Fortran (g77 -Wall) warnings of the form
    >> mona.f:101: warning: `jma' might be used uninitialized in this function

 5) a more thorough test of .Fortran("spannel", *) used in clusplot(*).

 ------------------

./R/daisy.q  :

  If daisy  objects  inherit from "dist",  we can use  as.matrix() and
  other dist methods which can be *very* useful !

  --> also upgraded ./man/dissimilarity.object.Rd
